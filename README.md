# Artificial-Intelligence
This Project involves training an agent on various search algorithms. It also involves making an intelligent agent using Markov Decision Process, dynamic path planning algorithms, Reinforcement learning, value iteration and q-learning, letting the agent to plan the path to reach the goal dynamically.
